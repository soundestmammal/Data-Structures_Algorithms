Data-Structures_Algorithms

What I would like to do is to make a full markdown document that will have all of the 
data structures and algorithms that I have learned in my Algorithms Spring 2019 course
with an explanation along with code snippets. I would like to implement it all in JavaScript and 
then time permitting in C++. This could be a lot of fun and will be exciting to work on.

Why am I doing this?

I feel that this could be a could study guide for myself having everything in one place with
just enough detail without becoming too complex.

Today is April 3 2019, and I will outline the next 3 steps I will take by April 05.

1) Write up content on the Stack Data Structure.
2) Insert Code into the markdown document to show implementation
3) Create the next objective.
